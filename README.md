# Cloud Platform GitHub Apps

Automate the registration, installation, and management of GitHub Apps for cloud platform workflows, with secure integration to Terraform Cloud.

---

## Overview

This project provides a modular solution for:

- Creating GitHub Apps using the Manifest Flow
- Automating app installation and credential retrieval
- Securely storing app secrets in Terraform Cloud workspaces
- Managing app installations and authentication for downstream automation

> [!TIP]
> Use the included GitHub Pages frontend for a user-friendly interface to trigger app creation and monitor status.

## Features

- **Frontend UI**: GitHub Pages dashboard for app creation and status
- **Backend Automation**: Python scripts and GitHub Actions for secure app provisioning
- **Terraform Cloud Integration**: Upload app credentials as sensitive variables
- **Issue-driven Automation**: Uses GitHub Issues to trigger backend workflows and track app registration & installation status
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend or customize for your organization

## Quick Start

1. **Configure your environment**

    - Set required secrets in your repository (e.g., `TFC_TOKEN`, `TFC_WORKSPACE_ID`, `GH_ISSUE_TOKEN`)
    - Update manifests in `docs/manifests.json` as needed

2. **Create a GitHub App**

    - Visit the GitHub Pages dashboard
    - Select or configure an app manifest
    - Follow the guided flow to register the app

3. **Automated Backend**

    - On issue creation, GitHub Actions will:
        - Parse the manifest and code
        - Complete app creation and installation
        - Upload credentials to Terraform Cloud
        - Close the issue when done

4. **Monitor Status**

    - Dashboard tiles reflect app status based on GitHub Issues:
        - ‚úÖ Created (closed issue)
        - ‚è≥ In Progress (open issue)
        - üöÄ Ready (no issue)
